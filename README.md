# A program which, given a dictionary, generates two output files, 'sequences' and 'words'. 'sequences' contains every sequence of four letters that appears in exactly one word of the dictionary, one sequence per line. 'words' contains the corresponding words that contain the sequences, in the same order, again one per line.
